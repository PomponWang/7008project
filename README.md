A survey on Recommendation system

# Environment

# OverView
A recommender system is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference" a user would give to an item. It is commonly used in various online platforms, such as e-commerce websites, streaming services, and social media platforms. The primary goal of a recommendation system is to provide personalized and targeted recommendations to users, ultimately enhancing their experience and helping them find what they are looking for. These recommendations are generated by analyzing and understanding user data, such as previous actions, preferences, demographic information, and feedback.
